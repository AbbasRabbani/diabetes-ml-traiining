# Deploying ML Model in notebooks using Azure ML Studio

In this post we will be using the Azure Machine Learning Studio to install a pre-written machine learning model. From setting up a resource group to getting an endpoint that you can access on any application that you want to use your machine learning model on, I will be walking you guys through the entire process.

## For the deployment I am using Azure, you can use any Cloud Platform

- Create a resource group
- Create Azure ML workspace
- Explore Azure Machine Learning Studio
- Create Compute Resources
- Prepare your Model
- Get the End points
